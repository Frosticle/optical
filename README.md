  Create Optical Mod

A mod based on transfer rotational force by light.

This addon adds new blocks, items and mechanics to the mod create.
Such as:
 - Optical Source: Emit different types of beams based on the rotational force applied;
 - Optical Receptor: Transform the received beam into rotational force based on its properties;
 - Optical Sensor: Emit redstone sinal based on the incident beam properties;
 - Mirror: Reflect the beam perpendicularly;
 - Polarizing Filter: Polarize the beam(duh);
 - Beam Splitter Cube: Split the beam in two and polarize the resultant beams perpendicularly;
   
All the crafts can be found with the JEI mod, and most of the additional mechanics can be found with the ponder(Create Mod) system.
